            <p class="text">I am continually tempted to implement lifecycle control
               			into coinjema -
               			ie,the ability to throw in annotations to your classes that allow coinjema
               			to notify
               			your objects of various lifecycle events - creation, finalization, etc.
               			But, I'm
               			resisting the urge because I think it's a problematic idea in the long run.
               			I'm
               			already noticing problems that happen when I get too aggressive about
               			calling
               			initialization routines in my constructors or dependency injection methods. Often
               			times, this results in problems with circular dependencies -
               			specifically when
               			dynamic dependencies are mixed with static. If I could resolve that, some of
               			these lifecycle issues would go away I think.

            <p class="text">JavaSpace ContextSource. Ie, store configuration data in a
               			JavaSpaces
               			service and let Coinjema automatically retrieve such objects and insert them
               			into
               			your objects. In general I'm thinking a lot about what it might
               			mean/enable if
               			Coinjema were fully jini-capable.

            <div class="title">Inheritable Property Files (March 24, 2006)</div>
            		
            <p class="text">
               			Several times I've run into the situation where I want a property
               			file that
               			gets default values from a property file in a base context,
               			but overrides just some of the
               			values in a sub-context. Right now,
               			you'd have to put all the values in every property
               			file. I get around
               			this currently by having my class depend on two property files, one
               			which holds the default values and another that holds the overriding
               			values and I call
               			<code>putAll()</code>
               			on my
               			<code>Properties</code>
               			object to override the values. A
               			little kludge that works well provided you only want/need a single default
               			set of
               			properties and a single overriding set of properties. I'd like to enable full
               			property
               			value inheritance from context to sub-context.

            <div class="title">Coinjema Finally In Use</div>
            		
            <p class="text">
               			I've finally started using Coinjema in an actual project, which has
               			helped me find some weaknesses in
               			Coinjema. Most notably, working out circular dependencies. I've also done some
               			work to make Coinjema thread-safe.
               			The result of both of these actions is that Coinjema performance is back
               			in the toilet (after some nice previous improvements
               			in that area). To be specific, object creation is approximately 50
               			times slower than normal when using Coinjema.
               			<span class="update">performance has since been improved to about 25x
                  				slower.</span>
               		
            </p>
            
            		
            <div class="title">Performance Issues</div>
            		
            <p class="text">25 times slower looks worse than it actually is. The
               			performance penalty is mostly restricted to object creation,
               			which is a small part of a system's performance to
               			begin with (discounting GC issues, which should not be affected by
               			Coinjema). Creating a normal object and setting a
               			couple of properties takes about 80 nanoseconds on my 1.8ghz centrino
               			laptop, and about 2000 nanoseconds for a Coinjema
               			configured object. There are 1 million nanoseconds in a millisecond - so you'd
               			have to create 1000 objects to decrease your
               			system's performance by ~2 milliseconds. It's a tradeoff that has to be
               			weighed against the advantages. Certainly one
               			wouldn't want DAO objects mapped to database table rows to be Coinjema
               			objects, but it probably wouldn't be too bad to
               			create a new Coinjema object or 3 or 10 for each http request to a servlet
               			engine.

            <p class="text">
               			A stickier problem is the issue of thread-safety. I've modified the
               			code to avoid obvious multi-threading
               			problems, but I remain concerned about the possibility of deadlocks if it were
               			used in a heavily multi-threaded
               			environment with very complex circular dependencies. I've not yet devised a test
               			case that reveals such a problem, but
               			I can imagine some that might. This is something I'll have to look
               			into soon.
               			<span class="update">Have since created tests that revealed deadlocks and

            <p class="text">
               			I'd like to play with the idea of using Coinjema to intercept calls
               			to getXXX() as opposed to
               			intercepting constructor calls and then configuring the objects at initialization
               			time. There would be three advantages
               			of doing so: Object construction would be quick; objects could be more
               			easily updated at runtime since every call
               			to getXXX() they make would go to Coinjema to retrieve the dependency;
               			and a single object could play in multiple
               			contexts rather than being fixed in a particular context at the moment of its
               			creation. The difficulty is figuring
               			out what the intended context is a the time of the call to getXXX().

            <p class="text">Another desirable feature with redirects would be to
               			preserve the original context through the redirect.
               			What this means is, let's say there is the root context:
            </p>
            		
            <div class="codeBlock">
               			<pre>

            <p class="text">And there is a child context:</p>
            		
            <div class="codeBlock">
               			<pre>
				child
				singleton.groovy
		</pre>
               		</div>
            		
            <p class="text">
               			The point of the
               			<span class="code">singleton.groovy</span>
               			entry in the child context is to supply
               			objects in that context with a separate instance of the singleton class -
               			could be a different implementation, could just
               			be configured differently. The problem here is, which instance of
               			singleton will
               			<span class="code">MyClass</span>
               			get
               			if it is created in the child context? Unfortunately, the answer is it
               			will get the root singleton because as Coinjema
               			searches for the
               			<span class="code">MyClass.singleton</span>
               			dependency, it finds it in the root context, and the redirect
               			therefore only searches
               			the root context. Therefore it is necessary to put another
               			<span class="code">Myclass.singleton.redirect</span>
               			into the child
               			context if it is desired that it find the context specific instance of
               			singleton (which seems like that natural
               			assumption to me). Removing this would remove some duplication in the config
               			files.
               			<span class="update">This is also done now.</span>

               			doing is creating context specific instances of the same class? Why can't
               			there be some way to tell Coinjema that the
               			root config file should be duplicated internally for each child context
               			that doesn't override it? This also would greatly
               			reduce the number of config files I have for my system, and I suspect for
