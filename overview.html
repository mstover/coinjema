<p class="text">Coinjema (<b>CO</b>ntext <b>INJE</b>ction <b>MA</b>chine)
		is an <i>experimental</i> Dependency Injection (DI) framework that uses AspectJ to 
		work behind the scenes.  Emphasis on experimental.
	</p>
<div class="title">What It Does</div>
<p class="text">When you instantiate a Java class, Coinjema
		intercepts the call and supplies the object with its dependent objects before the
		constructor returns.  It does this via aop (AspectJ) and annotations. It can also 
		intercept getter calls to deliver just-in-time dynamic dependencies (though this is 
		somewhat slower).</p>
<p class="text">Configuration files define these dependent objects. A large variety of file types
	    are supported, most notably groovy script files. Going through a series of
		possible locations for config files, Coinjema finds the appropriate script, executes
		it and passes the result into your new object.  Coinjema caches these results so that
		the scripts are only executed once (per context).</p>
<p class="text">Flexibility is provided via the procedure of finding the right
		config/script file. Dependency objects can be specifically for the Java class in question, they
		can be specifically for a <i>context</i>, and contexts can inherit from other contexts, 
		or Dependency objects can be shared by all Java classes in a particular context (ie think 
		singletons).  </p>
<p class="snippet">Coinjema uses AspectJ, Groovy, and Annotations from Java 5.0
		to do its work.</p>
<div class="title">Goals for Coinjema</div>
<p class="text">
		
<ol>
			
<li>More powerful configuration options</li>
			
<li>Simplify</li>
			
<li>Streamline configuration data</li>
			
<li>Self-contained Java classes</li>
		
</ol>
	
</p>
<div class="title">Simplifying Your Java</div>
<p class="text">There are a lot of frameworks out there that we, as developers,
		learn to use.  When writing an app, we spend a lot of time writing code
		that has little to do with the problem domain our app addresses.  Service
	    Locators, framework Singletons, Factories clutter our code that's really
        trying to be about a Pet Store (for example).  Coinjema is <i>almost</i>
        without an API.  This means you get automatic DI usually with minimal procedural
		invokations of methods on Coinjema classes.  Although you will have to use some
		declarative annotations, your source only looks like a solution to your problem.</p>
<p class="text">When you remove excess factories, service locators and static singletons and when
		it becomes simple again to just create new objects - even complex ones with complex
		dependencies - unit testing becomes much easier.  </p>
<div class="title">More Powerful Configuration</div>
<p class="text">Using XML for configuration seems to result in gigantic
		files that are very hard for a human to read, that require MBs of xml
		support code and more coding by the developer to traverse the resulting DOM for
		the information of interest.  Maybe worst of all is that these monstrous
		XML configuration files appear to be evolving into programming languages
		in their own right as we begin to dump therein all
		our dynamic/deployment-specific logic.</p>
<p class="text">Coinjema can use <a href="supported_file_formats.html">multiple file formats</a> 
	    out-of-the-box as its configuration language, including
	    Groovy, normal properties files, plain text, and even serialized java objects.  New formats can be
	    easily plugged in.  Thus Coinjema recognizes the legitimate desire to offload dynamic logic into an interpreted
		format, and yet without the pain of using XML as a programming language syntax, 
		for which it is awful.  Groovy is easier to learn for a Java programmer than
		an invented XML programming language, since its output is just a normal Java
		class or object - probably one defined by you.  Which is another advantage - no more
		manual retreival of untyped data from DOM trees to populate your objects.  
		Coinjema can supply your class with an precise arbitrary Java object it needs.</p>
<p class="text">As you get more comfortable using Coinjema to configure and wire your objects, you'll find yourself
	offloading more and more deployment specific details to these configuration files.  Because it is easy and because
	Coinjema allows you to insert configurable data into the nooks and crannies of your source code.</p>
<div class="title">Defining Your Context</div>
<p class="snippet">Coinjema was initially inspired by 
		<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=IOCandEJB">this article</a> 
		by Sony Mathew.</p>
<p class="text">A Java class that is simple enough that everything it needs can be 
	    supplied in 2-3 constructor parameters is a developer's joy.  One of the reasons
	    IoC/DI is becoming so popular is that it makes it easier to write such classes. The
	    class can specify what it needs in its constructore or setters, and an IoC container
	    takes care of supplying it.  Any class that can so clearly state its dependencies will
	    be far easier to write and maintain than one that spends many lines of code going out 
	    and retrieving its own dependencies.</p>
<p class="text">Coinjema doesn't do anything Spring or Plexus or Hivemind can't do, but it
		strives to make it a simpler process while at the same time providing powerful flexibility.  
		To use Coinjema, you will have to annotate your	classes and some methods (the annotations are now optional), and write tiny little 
		scripts (Groovy or properties files or simple text) where Coinjema can find them.  </p>
<p class="text">If Coinjema isn't a joy to use, then I've failed, because that's really my goal.  I love 
		the ideas behind projects like Spring and Avalon (before it died), but the implementations make
		me do a lot of tedious work.  And sometimes it seems like you do an awful lot of work, and then you
		sit back and realize just how little it got you.  </p>
