	<div class="title">What is a Coinjema Context?</div>
	<p class="text">A context in Coinjema is essentially a collection of tiny
		configuration scripts and a cache of dependency objects created from
		those
		scripts for your Java classes. Contexts are hierarchical, with
		single
		inheritance. A file directory structure is structurally similar
		to
		a hierarchy of Coinjema contexts.</p>

	<p class="text">Coinjema currently has a directory-based implementation and
		a JDBC-based implementation (URL based implementation is also on my
		wish-list).
		ContextSource defines a simple interface that Coinjema uses
		to
		retrieve configuration information from a data repository. Other
		implementations
		could be written to allow configuration data to be
		stored on a
		website, in LDAP, etc.</p>

	<p class="text">
		If we assume a file-based context source, configuring your app
		with
		Coinjema consists of writing multiple small (eg Groovy) scripts, each
		one
		responsible for creating a single dependency object. Coinjema will
		find
		your script and correctly apply it based on the name of that
		script, which
		must match the classnames involved and/or custom values
		passed to the
		<span class="code">@CoinjemaDependency</span>
		Annotation.
	</p>

	<p class="text">
		An example Groovy script that creates Logger objects
		for your objects'
		<span class="code">@CoinjemaDependency(alias="logger") setLogger(Logger
			l)</span>
		method.
		The script is named "Logger.groovy.perClass" (ignore the
		".perClass" bit for now, see
		<a href="supported_file_formats.html#file_endings">here</a>
		for an
		explanation).
		<div class="oneLinerCodeBlock">
			org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger(obj.getClass());
		</div>

		<p class="text">
			As specified in
			<a href="objectsProvided.html">Script Variables</a>
			,
			"obj" is a variable passed into the parameterized script refers to
			the
			object
			that is being dependency-fulfilled. You can also see how
			simple Groovy
			scripts
			are to use for this - the Logger object returned
			from the getLogger()
			method is
			assumed to be the returned value of the
			script.
		</p>

		<p class="text">Contexts inherit from their parent contexts - so if the
			above script
			didn't exist in the current context, then Coinjema would
			search the parent
			for
			a script of the same name, until one was found.
			So it is easy to
			create many
			customized contexts for your application
			without having to duplicate a lot
			of configuration data.</p>

		<div class="title">
			<a name="tracking"></a>
			Tracking the Current Context
		</div>

		<p class="text">Coinjema will automatically track context changes via the
			following
			mechanisms and triggers. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Objects created with explicit
				<code>CoinjemaContext</code>
				object. Objects created with an explicit
				<code>CoinjemaContext</code>
				argument passed to their constructor will trigger context tracking.
				This will handle 95% of most context-tracking needs.
			</li>
			<li>
				With the
				<code>@CoinjemaContextTrack Annotation</code>
				Coinjema can track a specific method or an entire class.
			</li>
			<li>
				The context for the current thread can be manually changed via
				<code>ContextFactory.pushContext(CoinjemaContext)</code>
				, but you must be sure to clear the change when you are finished
				via
				<code>ContextFactory.popContext()</code>
			</li>
			.
		</ul>
		<p class="text">Via these means, current context through your code's call
			graph is tracked. This
			means that if you create a new object and put
			it in a new context, objects
			subsequently created within your new
			object will automatically be
			part of the
			same context - ie:</p>

		<div class="oneLinerCodeBlock">new MyObject(new CoinjemaContext("altConfig");</div>

		<p class="text">If you create your object with this constructor (it is
			optional),
			Coinjema will put it into the "altConfig" context - and
			look for
			configuration
			data in that context.</p>

		<p class="text">Any calls this new object makes will be from within the
			"altConfig"
			context, thus any new objects created by your new MyObject
			will also be
			in the "altConfig" context. Furthermore, if, from within
			a call stack
			originating in this MyObject instance, a new object is
			created with a
			specified context, Coinjema will search for the new
			context starting
			relative from the current context. Thus, if a new
			object is created
			in the
			"secondConfig" context, Coinjema will first
			search for a context called
			"altConfig/secondConfig". If it doesn't
			find it, then it will look
			for
			a context called just "secondConfig".
		</p>

		<p class="text">
			To summarize: Context is preserved within a
			call stack until you
			change it. When you change it, Coinjema tries to
			find
			the new context
			as a relative path to the new context. For more details,
			see
			<a href="TheAnnotations.html">CoinjemaContextTrack annotation</a>
